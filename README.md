# Hi, I'm Jino Guinang! 

I am a **Civil Engineering Student** dedicated to building the future—both in digital blueprints and through physical grit. I bridge the gap between technical design and an active, adventurous lifestyle.

### 🛠️ Professional Toolkit
* **Design & Modeling:** Proficient in **AutoCAD** and **Revit**. I enjoy turning conceptual sketches into detailed 2D plans and 3D BIM models.
* **Engineering Mindset:** Currently honing my skills in structural analysis, materials science, and project management.

### 🌱 Currently Learning
* Advanced BIM workflows and sustainable construction methods.
* Mastering new calisthenics progressions (always chasing that next level of strength).

### ⚡ Life Outside the Classroom
* **Bodyweight Athlete:** I believe your body is the best gym. I'm big on calisthenics and functional movement.
* **Outdoor Enthusiast:** Whether it's hiking, trekking, or just exploring, I'm at my best when I'm outside.
* **Energy:** I'm all about having fun, staying positive, and bringing high energy to every project I join.
